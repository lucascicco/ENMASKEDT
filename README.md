# ENMASKEDT <img src="assets/images/mask.png" width=50 height=50>

ENMASKEDT APP is based on AI with TensorFlow Lite to detect if the user is wearing mask or not. Then, the most two important libraries on the project are "tflite" and "camera", the first one is connected to the model already "trained" and inserted into the "assets" folder, and the second one is to capture the live stream camera. Both are used together, 
camera after initialize starts the "startImageStream" and sends the imageFromStream to a variable in the state that will be used to base to the "tflite" gets the bytes.
